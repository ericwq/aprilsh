[Go: tests with HTML coverage report](https://kenanbek.medium.com/go-tests-with-html-coverage-report-f977da09552d)

## This command will run tests for the whole project.
```sh
go test -cover ./...
```

## In the first command, we use -coverprofile to save coverage results to the file. 
```sh
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
```

## we print detailed results by using Goâ€™s cover tool.
```sh
go tool cover -func=coverage.out
```

## By using the same cover tool, we can also view coverage result as an HTML page
```sh
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

## You can select coverage mode by using -covermode option:

```sh
go test -covermode=count -coverprofile=coverage.out
```

- set: did each statement run?
- count: how many times did each statement run?
- atomic: like count, but counts precisely in parallel programs

## Combined Unit and Integration Code Coverage

```sh
rm -rf coverage
mkdir -p coverage/unit -p coverage/int
```
### Run unit tests to collect coverage

```sh
go test -cover . -args -test.gocoverdir=./coverage/unit
```
### Retrieve total coverage

```sh
go tool covdata percent -i=./coverage/unit,./coverage/int
```

### Convert total coverage to cover profile

```sh
go tool covdata textfmt -i=./coverage/unit,./coverage/int -o coverage/profile
```

### View total coverage

```sh
go tool cover -func coverage/profile
go tool cover -html coverage/profile
```

### start server
```sh
go build -o ~/.local/bin/ashd .
~/.local/bin/apshd -verbose 1 2>> /tmp/apshd.log
GOCOVERDIR=./coverage/int ~/.local/bin/apshd -verbose 1 2>> /tmp/apshd.log
```
### start client
```sh
docker exec -u ide -it nvide ash
cd develop/aprilsh/frontend/client
go build -o apsh .
go build -race -o apsh .
./apsh -verbose 1  -pwd password ide@localhost 2>> /tmp/apsh.log
./apsh -verbose 1 -pwd password ide@172.17.0.3 2>> /tmp/apsh.log
```
### pprof
go tool pprof client cpu.profile
go test -bench=. -count 5 -run=^# -benchmem
